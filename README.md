# Unveiling the Evolution: A Decade of Social Media Platform Trends

This project aims to provide insights into the trends and characteristics of various social media platforms by analyzing their market share from 2009 to 2023. The analysis is based on the "social media popularity" dataset from Kaggle, which contains monthly data for 23 platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn, totaling 178 data points. The analysis involves data visualization and summary statistics to understand the relative popularity and engagement levels on each platform over time.

Based on the dataset, we focused on analyzing five key variables: Date, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We conducted a comprehensive analysis to derive insights from the summary statistics of these variables.

Additionally, an infographic was created to visually represent the findings. The infographic has been embedded in the HTML file generated from the R Markdown (RMD) for a more interactive and comprehensive presentation of the analysis.
